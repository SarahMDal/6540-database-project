## Table: `affiliations`

### Description: 

Information on affiliations. With a global view: clubs, residencies, festivals, record labels, agents, collectives, record shops, collaborations, radio stations that focus on electronic music. Artists may have many affiliations and over time, these will change. For example, it is not uncommon for artists to change record labels as they increase popularity, or even start their own. Collaborations is a very common practice, so most will have several collaborations with other artists. 

This table is important to provide a historical view of the artist's journey and is not currently found on existing databases. 

### Columns: 

| Column | Data type | Attributes | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| `affil_id` | INT | PRIMARY, Not null |   | Primary key |
| `affil_type` | VARCHAR(100) |  |   | Type of affiliation (e.g. club, residency, record label, collaboration, agent, radio station) Please only enter one type per id. For example, a record label like Soma Records will be its own record as many artists may release albums with Soma. |
| `affil_name` | VARCHAR(100) |  |   | Name of the affiliation, such as listed on its website. For example, The Lot Radio uses a capital 'T'. This could include other artists names as well, though we should expect spelling variations. |
| `affil_city` | VARCHAR(100) |  |   | The city where the affiliation is located, such as New York or Berlin.<br />Use country when city is not well known. For example, Berlin is well known, but Sugar Mountain should have the country identifier, Australia, as it is less well known to a general audience.<br /> |

For example, an artist may produce trance tracks, but within a sound that is typical of Berlin.
